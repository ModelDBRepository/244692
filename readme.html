This model was contributed by Shailesh Appukuttan.  It is written in the NEURON simulator which is freely available from<br/>
<a href="http://neuron.yale.edu">http://neuron.yale.edu</a><p/>
<p/>If you need more help than given below in running the simulation please consult this page:<br/>
<a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml</a><p/>
Usage:<br/>
------<br/>
Auto-launch from modeldb (if NEURON installed and the browser is configured) or download and extract the archive and start with a command like<p/>
nrngui mosinit.hoc
<p/>on unix/linux, or start the init.hoc file on mswin or mac os x.<p/>
The simulation launches automatically.  After a minute the simulation completes
and a figure with data associated with figure 3 in the paper is displayed:<p/>
